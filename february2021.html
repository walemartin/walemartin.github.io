    <h3>
        Lagos: Open and Thriving
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        While it is generally expressed that Lekki, the fastest growing area of Lagos,
        is the new Lagos, it is our opinion that Lagos State in its entirety, is the new Lagos;
        constantly reinventing itself to meet global standards while also working on regenerating
        its older neighbourhoods to arrive at a blend of lifestyles that keeps its residents satisfied.
        This is no easy feat with about 22 million people that call Lagos home, and we applaud the vision.
        Just like other global business  cities, there is the need to constantly evolve to cater to the annual
        influx of people and Lagos is not different. Multiple real estate developments continue to spring up
        across the state to cater to the various income levels of its citizens.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        On Lagos’ prime real estate side of, Ikoyi is one of the most expensive neighbourhoods
        in Nigeria with the exclusive Banana Island leading the pack as the most sought-after area
        to live in by wealthy Nigerians over the past year. Prices have increased significantly despite
        a global pandemic and we have found that exclusivity, good infrastructure and  security are the
        major drivers. Those who can afford prme real estate are willing to invest in developments that
        are comparable in quality to premium locations in  other global cities. This has positively
        impacted the wider Ikoyi neighbourhood of Onikoyi,  Shoreline Estate and Old Ikoyi and
        further into Victoria Island and Lekki Phase 1, where rapid infrastructure upgrades  have begun
        to match the residential and commercial prices commanded in these areas.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        There is a city we have all been waiting to emerge and it is of
        our opinion that it has now come of age. We are now in the emergence of
        Eko Atlantic City. Eko Atlantic City, a free zone developed by South Energyx
        Development Company FZE, a subsidiary of the Nigeria-based Chagoury Group of companies.
        It is a planned 10 million square metres city reclaimed from the ocean and protected by
        an 8.5-kilometre-long sea wall. The developer has the exuberant vision of creating the
        most sought-after luxurious city in West Africa and after years of anticipation, it is now coming to its own.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        When the Chagoury Group, who are also developers of Banana Island kicked off
        the demand for Banana Island, they built Ocean Parade; a multitower residential
        community with all the amenities local and expatriate communities could need.
        It marked the beginning of interest in the area and the initial buyers began to develop their properties.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The same blueprint has now been implemented by the Chagouray Group with
        the development of Azuri Towers, a planned 3-tower mixed use development
        with apartments, penthouses, villas, commercial and office spaces.
        They have also gone a step further by providing financing to own residential
        apartments through one of the largest banks in the country. We believe the
        development race has officially begun and  landowners  and investors who have
        been waiting for the right timing, will begin their developments within the coming years.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        We agree that the Lekki corridor cannot be ignored. Development is
        booming in that area with multiple middle- and high-income estates springing
        up regularly. Our spotlight is specifically on the Lekki Free Zone which is
        also flourishing with interest from local and international players. It is
        no longer news that the Dangote refinery is near completion and should be
        operational by 2023. It is the first movers of the Lagos Free Zone and Alaro City
        that are also worthy of commendation.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Lagos Free Zone, a privately owned 700 hectares development by
        Tolaram Group is now home to many big names in the industrial sector.
        Its location opposite the Lekki deep sea port which is expected to begin
        operations in 2022,  is a strategic decision for major stake holders that
        need the port. A virtual tour of the Lagos Free Zone is available
        <a href="https://youtu.be/ZhTIdYDGwEs" target="_blank">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Alaro City,  a joint venture development by the Lagos State Government
        and Rendeavour has also been outstanding in their ambition and fast paced
        development of a residential, commercial and industrial city on 1000 hectares
        with plans to expand into another thousand. It is also home to big industrial
        players and have recently launched their residential projects with the first 500 homes
        being built by Universal Homes. Take a
        tour of Alaro City here and the
        Universal Homes Development  <a href="https://360.hotlist.co.ke/unitywest/" target="_blank">here.</a>

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The relevance of Lagos to Nigeria, West Africa and Africa as a whole cannot
        be denied. Its continuous evolution is welcomed by all as we look forward to
        its inspiring vision to stand with other global business cities
